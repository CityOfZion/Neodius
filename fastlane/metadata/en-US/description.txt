Neodius was built with the idea to have a better insight into your Neo Crypto assets (love those hypie words :). Since NEO has that awesome GAS (neotogas.com click on about), it's good to see how much you have and how much you can claim. But most importantly, you want to know how many beers you can buy with your NEO. So i have implemented an automatic conversion from NEO to a (realistic) fiat value.
